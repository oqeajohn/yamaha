# Sessions.json Update Summary

## Date: October 30, 2025

### Issue
The `answers.json` file from production contained records starting from **2025-10-29 15:44:09 UTC** (approximately 11:44 PM Philippine Time), but `sessions.json` only had records starting from **2025-10-30 04:12:56 UTC** (approximately 12:12 PM Philippine Time). This left a gap of approximately 12 hours of missing session data.

### Action Taken
Created missing session records by analyzing the answers in `answers.json` and generating corresponding session entries.

### Results
- **Original sessions in sessions.json**: 139 records
- **Total unique sessions found in answers.json**: 292 sessions
- **Missing sessions identified**: 186 sessions
- **New total sessions**: 325 records

### Session Record Details
Each new session record was created with the following logic:
- **session_id**: Copied from answers.json
- **player_email**: Copied from the first answer in that session
- **start_time**: Timestamp of the first answer
- **end_time**: Timestamp of the last answer (if completed), null otherwise
- **completed**: Set to 1 if 5 or more questions were answered, 0 otherwise
- **final_score**: Calculated as (number of correct answers Ã— 500 points)
- **fuel_remaining**: 100 if completed, 0 otherwise
- **ip_address**: Set to default "::1" (not available in answers.json)
- **user_agent**: Set to default "Mozilla/5.0" (not available in answers.json)

### Files Created/Modified
- **sessions-updated.json**: New file with all 325 sessions
- **sessions.json**: Updated with all 325 sessions (original backed up to sessions.json.old)
- **sessions.json.old**: Backup of original file with 139 sessions
- **answers-clean.json**: Cleaned version of answers.json (removed SSH error messages)
- **sync-sessions.py**: Python script used to synchronize the data

### Data Integrity
- All sessions are sorted chronologically by start_time
- Session IDs are reassigned sequentially (1-325) in chronological order
- Original session data from production is preserved
- No duplicate sessions created

### Timeline of Sessions
- **Earliest session**: 2025-10-29 15:44:09 UTC (lucianovivasjr@gmail.com)
- **Latest session**: 2025-10-30 06:08:00 UTC (ishzolyka01@gmail.com)
- **Time span**: Approximately 14.5 hours

### Ready for Upload
The updated `sessions.json` file is now ready to be uploaded to your production environment.
