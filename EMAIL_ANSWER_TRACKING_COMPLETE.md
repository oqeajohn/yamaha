# Email-Based Answer Tracking - Implementation Complete

## What Was Done

Successfully implemented a comprehensive answer tracking system that logs every question answered by players, linked to their email addresses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (server.js)

#### Modified Endpoints:

- **POST /api/sessions/start**

  - Added `email` parameter to request body
  - Now stores `player_email` in sessions.json
  - Returns unique session_id for tracking

- **POST /api/sessions/answer**

  - Added `email` parameter to request body
  - Now stores `player_email` in answers.json
  - Links answer to both session_id and player email

- **POST /api/sessions/end**
  - Added `email` parameter to request body
  - Updates session with email if not already set
  - Stores final_score, fuel_remaining, and completed status

### 2. Frontend (js/game.js)

#### New Variables:

- `currentSessionId` - Stores the current game session ID for answer tracking

#### New Functions:

- **startGameSession()** - Calls `/api/sessions/start` with player email

  - Creates new session in backend
  - Stores returned session_id in currentSessionId variable
  - Called when game starts

- **recordAnswer(questionId, selectedAnswer, isCorrect)** - Calls `/api/sessions/answer`

  - Records each quiz answer with email
  - Sends question_id, selected_answer, is_correct
  - Links to current session_id and player_email

- **endGameSession(finalScore, fuelRemaining, completed)** - Calls `/api/sessions/end`
  - Updates session with final game results
  - Sends final_score, fuel_remaining, completed flag
  - Called when game ends (win or lose)

#### Modified Functions:

- **startGame()** - Now calls `startGameSession()` to initialize backend tracking
- **handleQuizAnswer()** - Now calls `recordAnswer()` when player answers
- **showVictoryMessage()** - Now calls `endGameSession()` when player wins
- **endGame()** - Now calls `endGameSession()` when player loses (runs out of fuel)

### 3. Data Storage

#### sessions.json Structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "session_id": "crypto-random-id",
  "player_email": "player@example.com",
  "start_time": "2025-01-26T10:00:00.000Z",
  "end_time": "2025-01-26T10:05:00.000Z",
  "final_score": 15000,
  "fuel_remaining": 20,
  "completed": 1,
  "ip_address": "::1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

#### answers.json Structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "session_id": "crypto-random-id",
  "player_email": "player@example.com",
  "question_id": 1,
  "selected_answer": 0,
  "is_correct": 1,
  "answered_at": "2025-01-26T10:02:00.000Z"
}
```

## Complete Game Flow

1. **Player enters email** → Stored in sessionStorage
2. **Game starts** → `startGameSession()` creates session with email
3. **Tunnel 1: Question 1 appears** → Player answers → `recordAnswer()` logs to backend
4. **Tunnel 2: Question 2 appears** → Player answers → `recordAnswer()` logs to backend
5. **Tunnel 3: Question 3 appears** → Player answers → `recordAnswer()` logs to backend
6. **Finish line reached** → `endGameSession()` finalizes session
7. **Victory screen** → Can play again (new session) or claim prize

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Player History**: Every answer from every session is tracked by email
✅ **Session Tracking**: Each game session has unique ID linking all answers
✅ **Question Analytics**: See which questions are hardest/easiest
✅ **Performance Metrics**: Calculate success rates per player
✅ **Replay Value**: Multiple sessions per player are tracked separately
✅ **Email-Based Reporting**: Generate reports by player email

## Testing the System

1. **Start Server**: `npm start`
2. **Open Game**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Enter Email**: Type email and click "Start Playing"
4. **Play Game**: Answer all 3 quiz questions
5. **Check Data**:
   - Open `admin/data/sessions.json` - See session with your email
   - Open `admin/data/answers.json` - See your 3 answers with email

## Example Queries

### Get all answers for a specific player:

```javascript
const answers = require("./admin/data/answers.json").answers;
const playerEmail = "john@example.com";
const playerAnswers = answers.filter((a) => a.player_email === playerEmail);
console.log(`Total answers by ${playerEmail}:`, playerAnswers.length);
```

### Calculate player success rate:

```javascript
const correct = playerAnswers.filter((a) => a.is_correct === 1).length;
const total = playerAnswers.length;
const successRate = ((correct / total) * 100).toFixed(2);
console.log(`Success rate: ${successRate}%`);
```

### Get all sessions for a player:

```javascript
const sessions = require("./admin/data/sessions.json").sessions;
const playerSessions = sessions.filter((s) => s.player_email === playerEmail);
console.log(`Total games played:`, playerSessions.length);
```

### Find difficult questions:

```javascript
const questionStats = {};
answers.forEach((a) => {
  if (!questionStats[a.question_id]) {
    questionStats[a.question_id] = { correct: 0, total: 0 };
  }
  questionStats[a.question_id].total++;
  if (a.is_correct) questionStats[a.question_id].correct++;
});

for (let qid in questionStats) {
  const stat = questionStats[qid];
  const successRate = ((stat.correct / stat.total) * 100).toFixed(2);
  console.log(`Question ${qid}: ${successRate}% success rate`);
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `/server.js` - Updated 3 session endpoints to include email
2. `/js/game.js` - Added 4 functions + modified 4 existing functions
3. `/admin/data/sessions.json` - Now includes player_email field
4. `/admin/data/answers.json` - Now includes player_email field

## Documentation Created

1. `ANSWER_TRACKING.md` - Comprehensive guide to the tracking system
2. `EMAIL_ANSWER_TRACKING_COMPLETE.md` - This implementation summary

## Server Status

✅ Server running on port 3000
✅ All endpoints tested and working
✅ Game fully functional with tracking enabled

## Next Steps

The system is ready to use! You can now:

- Play the game and see answers being tracked
- Access admin dashboard at http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard-vue.html
- Build custom reports using the JSON data files
- Add API endpoints to query answers/sessions if needed
